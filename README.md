# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the school district analysis:
### Background
The school board has uncovered evidence of academic dishonesty.  The full extent is unknown.  Alteration of reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders are at issue.  Maria has asked for full audit after replacement of the math and reading scores for Thomas High School ninth graders with NaNs, while making no other changes to the data. Once the revision has been made, Maria has requested a repeat run of the school district analysis (with the suspect grades not considered) and a report detailing how the data changes affected the overall analysis.

### Deliverables requested include:
* District summary DataFrame 
* School summary DataFrame 
* Top 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate 
* Bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate 
* Average math score for each grade level from each school 
* Average reading score for each grade level from each school 
* Scores by school spending per student 
* Scores by school size 
* Scores by school type 

## Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.
